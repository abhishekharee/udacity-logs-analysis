# Project: Logs Analysis

## Description
This project contains a python script (LogsAnalysis.py) that prints answers to the following questions, based on data stored in the 'news' database - a database supplied by Udacity:

1. What are the most popular three articles of all time?
2. Who are the most popular article authors of all time?
3. On which days did more than 1% of requests lead to errors?

## Languages
The Python script is written in Python 3, and the SQL code is written in the dialect used by PostgreSQL

## Dependencies
This project requires the following to be in place prior to successful execution:
- python3
- psql
- bash
- the 'news' database (downloadable from the Udacity Full Stack Web Deveoper Nanodegree course)

## Execution
Assuming the dependencies are in place, answers to the above questions are retrieved by running the following command in bash:

`python3 LogsAnalysis.py`

The output of the above command is stored in the LogsAnalysisOutputs.txt file in this repository.
